    TOPN(3, staff, staff[salary], DESC)
)
6. Qualification vs Salary:

Y-Axis: Cumulative Headcount
New Measure: 
Cumulative Headcount = 
VAR currentDate = LASTDATE(staff[date_of_join])
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(staff[EmpID]),

        staff[date_of_join] <= currentDate
    )
)
8. Employee Filter by Starting Letter:
What it shows: Filters employees by the first letter of their name.

________________________________________
Design and Layout Notes:
Canvas Background: Opt for a neutral or soft color that allows the charts and cards to stand out.
Card Visuals: 
Use blue fill for cards to create a uniform, clean design.
Use Arial font for numeric values and Segoe UI for labels to maintain readability.
Shadows and Borders: Enable shadows and borders for card visuals to help them stand out.
Slicers: Implement slicers for interactivity, including filters for job title and employee names.

Power Query Transformations:
Data Cleaning:
Remove duplicates in the dataset to ensure accuracy.
Sort data as required for each visualization (e.g., sorting by salary, date of join).
Create Conditional Columns:
Categorize education qualifications using Conditional Columns.
For example, classify High School as 1, Degree as 2, and Post-Graduate as 3.
This can be done using Power Query’s conditional logic options.
Data Types:
Ensure the Date of Join column is set as a Date type for time-based calculations.
Ensure Salary and Leave Balance columns are set as Numeric types.
